# Hotkeys Guide

## Simplified Hotkey System

The application now uses a simplified hotkey system with **one key for hide/unhide functionality**.

### Available Hotkeys

| Hotkey | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Alt+Shift+H` | **Toggle Hide/Show** | Single key to hide or show the window |
| `Alt+Shift+L` | Toggle Listening | Start/stop voice recognition |
| `Alt+Shift+S` | Toggle Smart Mode | Enable/disable resume-based responses |
| `Alt+Shift+R` | Upload Resume | Open file dialog to upload resume |
| `Alt+Shift+C` | Clear Answers | Clear all previous answers |
| `Alt+Shift+Q` | Quit Application | Close the application |

### Hide/Show Behavior

- **When visible**: `Alt+Shift+H` hides the window
- **When hidden**: `Alt+Shift+H` shows the window and brings it to front
- **Status indicator**: The listening status shows "Window hidden. Press Alt+Shift+H to show." when hidden

### Benefits

1. **Simplified**: Only one key to remember for hide/show
2. **Intuitive**: Same key toggles between states
3. **Consistent**: Works the same way across all platforms
4. **User-friendly**: Clear status messages guide the user

### Usage Tips

- Use `Alt+Shift+H` to quickly hide the window during interviews
- Press `Alt+Shift+H` again to bring it back when needed
- The window stays on top when shown, making it easy to read answers
- All other functionality remains unchanged
